b) The posterior for n increases with the observed number of buyers Y and decreases as the purchase probability theta increases
d) The posterior predictive for future buyers Y\* is broader than the posterior for n, because it accounts for both uncertainty in n and randomness in individual purchase decisions. Even if n is somewhat certain, the predictive distribution spreads due to Binomial randomness.
